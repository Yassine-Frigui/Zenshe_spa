# Rate Limiting Fix for Admin Dashboard

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Issue**: Admin dashboard was being rate-limited, causing 429 errors and blocking legitimate admin operations

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Rate Limiting Applied to Admin Routes**
- **Issue**: The `generalLimiter` (100 requests per 15 minutes) was applied globally to ALL routes including `/api/admin/*`
- **Impact**: Admin dashboard with statistics polling would quickly hit the limit
- **Why it's wrong**: Admins working on their dashboard need unrestricted access to perform their job

### 2. **Statistics Endpoints Being Rate Limited**
- **Endpoint**: `/api/admin/statistics/draft-performance?period=30`
- **Behavior**: The admin statistics page makes 2 parallel requests on load and every time `dateRange` changes:
  1. `adminAPI.getStatistics(dateRange)` 
  2. `adminAPI.getDraftPerformance(period)`
- **Issue**: With refreshes, tab changes, and normal usage, admins would hit 100 requests quickly
- **CORS Issue**: Port 3001 was also missing from allowed origins (now fixed)

### 3. **Original Rate Limit Too Restrictive**
- **Previous**: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- **Reality**: Admin dashboard can easily generate:
  - 2 requests per page load
  - Multiple page loads during work session
  - Statistics refreshes
  - Product image uploads
  - Order management operations
  - Category/product CRUD operations

## Solution Implemented

### Changes to `backend/src/middleware/security.js`

```javascript
const generalLimiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 1000, // Increased from 100 to 1000
    message: {
        error: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.',
        retryAfter: '15 minutes'
    },
    standardHeaders: true,
    legacyHeaders: false,
    // NEW: Skip rate limiting for admin routes entirely
    skip: (req) => {
        return req.path.startsWith('/api/admin');
    }
});
```

### Key Changes:
1. ✅ **Increased max from 100 → 1000** - More headroom for legitimate users
2. ✅ **Added skip function** - Admin routes (`/api/admin/*`) are completely exempt from rate limiting
3. ✅ **Added CORS support for port 3001** - Vite default port now allowed (in `app.js`)

## Rate Limiting Strategy

### Protected with Strict Limits:
- **Auth Routes** (`/api/auth/*`): 5 requests per 15 minutes
- **Reservation Routes** (`/api/reservations/*`): 10 requests per hour  
- **Public Routes**: 1000 requests per 15 minutes

### Exempt from Rate Limiting:
- **Admin Routes** (`/api/admin/*`): No limit
  - `/api/admin/statistics/*`
  - `/api/admin/store/*`
  - All other admin endpoints

### Why This Makes Sense:
1. **Authentication** needs strict limits to prevent brute force attacks
2. **Reservations** need moderate limits to prevent spam/abuse
3. **Admin operations** should NOT be limited - they're authenticated users doing their job
4. **Public routes** have high limits for normal browsing (1000 per 15 min = ~1 request per second)

## Testing Checklist

After backend restart, verify:
- [ ] Admin statistics page loads without 429 errors
- [ ] Changing date range (week/month/quarter) works smoothly
- [ ] Multiple refreshes don't trigger rate limits
- [ ] CORS errors are gone (check browser console)
- [ ] Image upload in admin store works
- [ ] Product/order management operations work
- [ ] Public pages still have rate limiting active

## Request Analysis

### Admin Statistics Page - Request Pattern:
```
Page Load:
  ├── GET /api/admin/statistics?dateRange=month
  └── GET /api/admin/statistics/draft-performance?period=30

Change Date Range to "week":
  ├── GET /api/admin/statistics?dateRange=week
  └── GET /api/admin/statistics/draft-performance?period=7

Change Date Range to "quarter":
  ├── GET /api/admin/statistics?dateRange=quarter
  └── GET /api/admin/statistics/draft-performance?period=90
```

**Total**: 2 requests per interaction  
**Typical session**: ~10-20 requests (totally reasonable for admin dashboard)

### Why Duplicates Don't Exist:
- The 2 requests are DIFFERENT endpoints (not duplicates)
- `getStatistics()` returns overview, financial, client, service data
- `getDraftPerformance()` returns draft-specific metrics
- Both are needed for comprehensive dashboard
- Using `Promise.all` ensures they run in parallel (efficient)

## Security Considerations

### What We Keep:
✅ Authentication rate limiting (prevents brute force)  
✅ Reservation rate limiting (prevents spam)  
✅ XSS sanitization  
✅ Security headers (Helmet)  
✅ CORS restrictions  
✅ Input validation

### What We Relax:
✅ Admin route rate limits (they're authenticated, let them work)  
✅ General rate limit increased (1000 is still protective against DDoS)

### Why This Is Safe:
1. Admin routes require authentication token (already protected)
2. Only authenticated admins can access `/api/admin/*`
3. If someone has admin token, rate limiting won't stop them anyway
4. Real protection is authentication + authorization, not rate limiting

## Recommendations

### For Production:
1. Consider adding admin activity logging for audit trails
2. Monitor admin API usage patterns
3. Set up alerts for unusual admin activity patterns
4. Consider IP whitelisting for admin access if feasible

### For Development:
1. Current settings are perfect for dev environment
2. No changes needed

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `backend/src/middleware/security.js` - Updated generalLimiter with skip function
2. ✅ `backend/src/app.js` - Added CORS support for localhost:3001

2. Test admin statistics page thoroughly
3. Verify no CORS or 429 errors in console
4. Monitor logs for any issues
5. Consider implementing admin activity dashboard in future
