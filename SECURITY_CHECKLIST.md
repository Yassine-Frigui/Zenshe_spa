- [ ] 🔧 Uptime monitoring
- [ ] 🔧 Security incident alerting

## 🔧 RECOMMENDED - Should Complete Soon

### 🎯 Additional Security Measures
- [ ] Implement API versioning
- [ ] Add request signing for sensitive operations  
- [ ] Session management improvements
- [ ] Implement audit trail logging
- [ ] Add honeypot fields to forms
- [ ] Web Application Firewall (WAF)

### 📱 Frontend Security
- [ ] Remove console.log statements from production build
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy
- [ ] Add integrity checks for external scripts
- [ ] Secure local storage usage
- [ ] HTTPS-only cookies

### 🚀 Performance & Reliability  
- [ ] Database connection pooling optimization
- [ ] Implement caching strategy
- [ ] Load balancing configuration
- [ ] Graceful error handling
- [ ] Health check endpoints

## 🛠️ Pre-Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create production environment file
cp .env.production.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production with actual values
nano .env.production
```

### 2. Security Configuration
```bash
# Generate strong JWT secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"

# Generate session secret  
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### 3. Database Setup
```sql
-- Create dedicated database user
CREATE USER 'zenshespa_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'STRONG_PASSWORD_HERE';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON zenshespa_production.* TO 'zenshespa_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### 4. SSL Certificate Setup
```bash
# Install SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt example)
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
```

### 5. Final Security Verification
```bash
# Run security audit
npm audit
# Check for outdated packages  
npm outdated
# Test security headers
curl -I https://yourdomain.com
```

## 🚨 Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### High Priority Issues Resolved:
1. **Authentication Bypass Removed** - Eliminated dangerous development bypass
2. **Rate Limiting Added** - Protected against brute force attacks
3. **Input Validation** - Added comprehensive input sanitization
4. **Security Headers** - Implemented Helmet.js protection
5. **XSS Protection** - Added content sanitization
6. **CORS Hardening** - Restricted cross-origin requests

### Security Improvements Made:
- JWT token validation strengthened
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- SQL injection prevention verified
- Request size limits implemented
- Security event logging added
- Production environment template created

## 🎯 Next Steps for Production
