## Known Limitations

### Current Version (v1.0.0)

**Backend Display:**
- Some nested objects show as `[object Object]` in HTML display
- This is a display-only issue, actual data is stored correctly
- Workaround: Use `/submissions/all` endpoint for JSON access

**CORS:**
- CORS not enabled by default
- Must manually add cors() middleware for cross-origin access
- See DEPLOYMENT.md for instructions

**Environment Variables:**
- API keys hardcoded in server.js by default
- Must manually edit file or set up .env
- See README.md for .env setup

**Form Customization:**
- Requires re-exporting from JotForm if form structure changes
- No GUI for field mapping updates
- Must manually update FIELD_MAPPING in server.js

### Not Implemented Yet

- No built-in authentication
- No submission editing from frontend
- No automated backups
- No email notifications
- No PDF export
- No analytics/reporting

## Migration Guide

### From Separate Frontend/Backend to Standalone

If you were using the old EXPORTABLE_ZENSHE_FORM/ structure:

1. **API URLs:** No change needed (still localhost:3001)
2. **File Structure:** Everything now in one folder
3. **Dependencies:** Single package.json instead of two
4. **Scripts:** Use `npm start` instead of running two terminals
5. **Configuration:** Same API keys in server.js

**Breaking Changes:** None - API is identical
