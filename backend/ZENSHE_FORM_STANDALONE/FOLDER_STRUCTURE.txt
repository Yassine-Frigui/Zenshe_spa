WHAT EACH FILE DOES:

server/server.js
  ✅ Express server on port 3001
  ✅ Fetches submissions from JotForm API
  ✅ Parses and displays submissions with French labels
  ✅ Handles form submissions (forwards to JotForm)
  ✅ 90+ field mapping with proper labels

src/App.jsx
  ✅ React component that displays the form
  ✅ Purple gradient card wrapper (85vh scrollable)
  ✅ Loads form HTML from public/jotform_zenshe_form.html
  ✅ Sequential script loading (fixes date picker)
  ✅ Intercepts form submission
  ✅ Sends data to backend server

public/jotform_zenshe_form.html
  ✅ Original JotForm HTML (1622 lines)
  ✅ All branding removed (3 scripts deleted)
  ✅ Date picker works correctly
  ✅ All form fields intact

package.json
  ✅ Contains ALL dependencies (frontend + backend)
  ✅ Scripts to start both servers
  ✅ Uses "concurrently" to run both at once

---

HOW IT WORKS TOGETHER:

1. User runs: npm start
   ↓
2. Concurrently starts:
   - Frontend (Vite) on http://localhost:5173
   - Backend (Express) on http://localhost:3001
   ↓
3. User opens browser: http://localhost:5173
   ↓
4. React App.jsx loads and fetches: /jotform_zenshe_form.html
   ↓
5. Form HTML is injected with proper script loading
   ↓
6. User fills and submits form
   ↓
7. App.jsx intercepts submission → POSTs to backend
   ↓
8. Backend converts data → POSTs to JotForm API
   ↓
9. JotForm stores submission
   ↓
10. Backend returns success → Frontend shows alert

---

PORTS USED:
- Frontend: 5173 (Vite dev server)
- Backend:  3001 (Express server)

---

DEPENDENCIES INSTALLED:
- Frontend: react, react-dom, vite
- Backend: express, body-parser, node-fetch
- Dev: concurrently (runs both servers at once)

---

FILES YOU NEED TO EDIT:
✅ server/server.js (lines 9-10) - API_KEY and FORM_ID
❌ Everything else works out of the box!

---

COMPLETELY SELF-CONTAINED:
✅ No external files needed
✅ No parent directory references
✅ Can be copied/moved anywhere
✅ Just needs: npm install → npm start
