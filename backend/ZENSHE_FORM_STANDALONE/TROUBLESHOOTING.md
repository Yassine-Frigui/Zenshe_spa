# 🔧 Troubleshooting: Form Submission Not Working

## Common Issue: "Form doesn't send to backend"

If your form submission isn't working, follow this checklist:

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Diagnostic

### Step 1: Is the Backend Running?

**Check manually:**
```bash
# Open a new terminal in ZENSHE_FORM_STANDALONE directory
npm run server
```

**You should see:**
```
🚀 Zenshe Backend Starting...
🔗 JotForm API: Connected (Form ID: 251824851270052)
✅ Ready to handle form submissions at /submit-form
🌐 Backend listening on http://localhost:3001
```

**Quick test:**
```bash
# Run the test script
TEST_BACKEND.bat
```

---

### Step 2: Is the Frontend Running?

**Check:**
```bash
# Open a new terminal in ZENSHE_FORM_STANDALONE directory
npm run dev
```

**You should see:**
```
VITE v7.1.9  ready in 500 ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

---

### Step 3: Check Browser Console

**Open browser console (F12) and look for:**

✅ **Good signs:**
```
✅ Loaded cleaned Zenshe form HTML (branding removed at source)
✅ Form rendered with all scripts loaded and executed
📋 Form found, hiding native submit button
✅ Form setup complete - use custom submit button
```

❌ **Bad signs:**
```
❌ Form element not found in DOM
❌ No form data collected
❌ Failed to fetch
❌ Network error
```

---

### Step 4: Test the Custom Button

**Click "Soumettre le Formulaire" and watch console:**

✅ **If working, you'll see:**
```
📤 Custom submit button clicked
✅ Form element found: <form>
📊 Form data collected: 45 fields
📋 First few fields: ["q9_nom9", "q10_adresseMail10", ...]
📤 Sending to backend: http://localhost:3001/submit-form
📡 Response status: 200
📥 Response from backend: {success: true, submissionId: "..."}
✅ Form submitted successfully!
```

❌ **If NOT working, you'll see one of these:**

**Issue A: Backend not running**
```
❌ Network error: Failed to fetch
```
**Solution:** Start backend with `npm run server`

**Issue B: No form data**
```
📊 Form data collected: 0 fields
❌ No form data collected - form might not be properly loaded
```
**Solution:** Wait for form to fully load, or refresh page

**Issue C: Backend error**
```
📡 Response status: 500
❌ HTTP error! status: 500
```
**Solution:** Check backend terminal for error messages

## 🔍 Detailed Troubleshooting

### Problem: Backend Won't Start

**Error: "Cannot find module 'express'"**
```bash
# Solution: Install dependencies
npm install
```

**Error: "Port 3001 already in use"**
```bash
# Solution: Kill existing process
# Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or change port in server/server.js:
const PORT = 3002; // Use different port
```

**Error: "SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement"**
```bash
# Solution: Make sure package.json has "type": "module"
# It should already be there
```

---

### Problem: Frontend Shows Blank Page

**Check 1: Is Vite running?**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Check 2: Browser console errors?**
- Open F12
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Look for red error messages

**Check 3: Form HTML file missing?**
```bash
# Make sure this file exists:
public/jotform_zenshe_form.html
```

---

### Problem: Form Loads But Button Does Nothing

**Check 1: Is button visible?**
- Scroll to bottom of form
- Look for purple button "Soumettre le Formulaire"

**Check 2: Is button enabled?**
- Should NOT be greyed out
- Should be clickable
- Should show loading spinner when clicked

**Check 3: Browser console**
```javascript
// After clicking button, should see:
📤 Custom submit button clicked
✅ Form element found
```

**If you see:**
```javascript
❌ Form element not found in DOM
```
**Solution:** Form didn't load properly, refresh page

---

### Problem: "Failed to Fetch" Error

**Cause: Backend not reachable**

**Check 1: Backend running?**
```bash
# In separate terminal:
npm run server
```

**Check 2: Correct URL?**
- Frontend should connect to: `http://localhost:3001`
- Check `src/App.jsx` line ~194:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/submit-form', {
```

**Check 3: CORS enabled?**
- Check `server/server.js` has CORS headers (lines 19-27)
- Should see:
```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  // ...
});
```

**Check 4: Firewall blocking?**
- Temporarily disable firewall to test
- Or allow Node.js through firewall

---

### Problem: Form Submits But Shows Error

**Check Backend Terminal:**

Look for these messages:
```
📝 Form submission received
📤 Submitting to JotForm API...
```

**If you see:**
```
❌ JotForm API error: Invalid API key
```
**Solution:** Update API key in `server/server.js` line 9

**If you see:**
```
❌ JotForm API error: Form not found
```
**Solution:** Update Form ID in `server/server.js` line 10

---

### Problem: No Data Collected (0 fields)

**Cause: Form fields not populated**

**Solution 1: Fill out at least one field**
- Enter name, email, or any field
- Then click submit

**Solution 2: Form not fully loaded**
- Wait 2-3 seconds after page loads
- Look for form to finish rendering
- Then try submitting

**Solution 3: JavaScript error**
- Check browser console (F12)
- Look for red error messages
- They might block form from working

---

## 🚀 Quick Reset Procedure

If nothing works, try this complete reset:

```bash
# 1. Stop all running processes (Ctrl+C in terminals)

# 2. Kill any stuck Node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# 3. Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start backend
npm run server

# 5. In NEW terminal, start frontend
npm run dev

# 6. Open browser to http://localhost:5173

# 7. Fill out form and click custom submit button
```

---

## 📋 Pre-flight Checklist

Before submitting form, verify:

- [ ] Backend terminal shows: "Backend listening on http://localhost:3001"
- [ ] Frontend terminal shows: "Local: http://localhost:5173"
- [ ] Browser shows form (purple card)
- [ ] Custom purple button visible at bottom
- [ ] Browser console (F12) shows no errors
- [ ] At least one form field filled out
- [ ] Button is not disabled/greyed out

---

## 🔬 Advanced Debugging

### Test Backend Directly (Without Frontend)

```bash
# Test if backend is alive
curl http://localhost:3001

# Test submit endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/submit-form ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"q9_nom9\":{\"first\":\"Test\",\"last\":\"User\"},\"q10_adresseMail10\":\"test@example.com\"}"
```

### Check Network Tab

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Click custom submit button
4. Look for request to `localhost:3001/submit-form`
5. Check:
   - Status code (should be 200)
   - Response body
   - Request payload

### Enable Verbose Logging

Add to `src/App.jsx` before fetch:
```javascript
console.log('📤 Request body:', JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
```

Add to `server/server.js` in `/submit-form` endpoint:
```javascript
console.log('📥 Received data:', JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
```

## 📞 Still Not Working?

If you've tried everything above:

1. **Check this file for errors:**
   - `ZENSHE_FORM_STANDALONE/src/App.jsx`
   - Look for the `handleCustomSubmit` function
   - Make sure it's not throwing errors

2. **Check backend logs:**
   - Terminal where `npm run server` is running
   - Look for error messages in red

3. **Try the test script:**
   ```bash
   node test-submission-v2.js
   ```

4. **Check JotForm API:**
   - Go to https://www.jotform.com/myaccount/api
   - Verify API key is valid
   - Check rate limits
